An interface to analyze photos with ChatGPT since there is currently a waitlist for ChatGPT Plus.

## First time setup:

1. Ensure you have python installed
2. `python -m venv venv` to create a virtual environment
3. `. venv/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment on Mac/Linux and `.\venv\Scripts\activate.bat` on Windows
4. `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install requirements
5. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and paste your OpenAI API key in place of `your-key-here` in the file
    - IMPORTANT: Make sure to never share this file with anyone or check it in to source control

## To use the App
1. From the project directory, open a terminal and activate the virtual environment
    1. `. venv/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment on Mac/Linux and `.\venv\Scripts\activate.bat` on Windows
1. Run `streamlit run app.py` in a terminal (with the virtual environment activated) to launch the app
2. You can type a message to get a response

3. Or you can upload an image to ask something about it. Here I uploaded `component.png` and asked ChatGPT to write the code for the interface. Then output can be seen in `component.html`.

4. The chat has memory so you can ask about previous messages

## How it was made

I had a conversation with ChatGPT to write the interface in `chat.ipynb`. First, I wrote some simple code to interact with ChatGPT via the OpenAI API. Then, I asked ChatGPT to write a streamlit app, passing in an image of what I wanted (`ui.png`). I then asked for with follow up changes to iteratively alter the interface. The final application code is in `app.py`. It even made changes to the original code that I used to interact with it. The final code can be seen in `chat_bot.py`.
